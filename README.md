Hey there, I’m Julian, father of two 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 and a software developer 👨‍💻 located near Frankfurt am Main in Germany. After doing my Master in Computer Science / Application Engineering I worked for over 7 years at Capgemini as software developer and architect, mostly in a large-scale project in the public security domain. Currently, I make a living at the dwpbank AG and help them to migrate their core banking / trading systems from a dated mainframe architecture to a modern event-driven microservices architecture. I love working in an agile way and fulfilled most of the agile roles at least partly in my past projects. Beside working in the dev team I enjoy working as Scrum Master.

Beside running 🏃‍♂️ and being interested in battery electric vehicles 🚗⚡ I am interested in all the things technical or nerdy. This includes:

- Software architecture (let it be of one application or large-scale in a distributed system)
- Cloud and SaaS applications
- Clean code / software craftsmanship
- Bootstrapping / Indie hacking
- Documentation as code


The technical ecosystem I have the most experience is the following (but I prefer using the best suited technologies for a specific problem if possible):

- Java
- Spring Boot (and its ecosystem)
- Postgres
- Angular
- Apache Kafka
- Containers
- Linux
- Load testing (Gatling)
